## Verification — 2026-06-12

### ✅ Format Validator

Scan result:
- Invalid sub_tags: **0**
- Empty sub_tags: **0**

The previously approved `system` → `research` fixes are complete.

---

### ✅ Sources trống

Scan result:
- Concepts with empty `## Sources`: **0**

The previously empty sources in:
- `ai-powered-discovery.md`
- `second-order-effects.md`

are now fixed.

---

### ✅ Key ideas <3

Fix Agent review result accepted:
- Most flagged files were false positives because they use structured subsections (`###`) instead of bullet-only `## Key ideas` lists.
- Only `retail-trading-fantasy.md` was genuinely underdeveloped.
- `retail-trading-fantasy.md` was expanded from 2 to 5 bullet points using source notes.

Validator note: bullet-count-only detection still flags some subsection-style files, but this is not treated as an actionable issue in this pass.
