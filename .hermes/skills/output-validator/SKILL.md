description: Validates content quality of wiki files (sources and concepts). Checks factual accuracy, completeness, coherence, and Vietnamese language quality. Use daily at 22:00 after Index Agent completes, or when user says "validate output", "check content quality". Reads wiki/sources/ and wiki/concepts/, generates quality report in wiki/reviews/, does NOT modify any wiki files.
when_to_use: Daily 23:00 validation run (after Index Agent, before Hygiene Inspector), or on-demand when Julius requests content quality check. Runs after Compile Agent has processed new content.

# Output Validator

Ensures wiki content meets quality standards across four dimensions: factual accuracy, completeness, coherence, and Vietnamese language quality.

## Role

Read all wiki files (`wiki/sources/*.md` + `wiki/concepts/*.md`), validate content quality, generate report listing issues with severity levels. Report goes to `wiki/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD_output-report.md` and updates `wiki/reviews/_action-required.md`.

**Critical**: This validator only reads and reports. Never modifies wiki files. Fix Agent applies corrections after Julius approves.

## When to use

- **Daily**: 22:00 (after Index Agent completes, before Hygiene Inspector)
- **On-demand**: Julius says "validate output" or "check content quality"
- **After bulk operations**: Re-compilation, mass edits, migration

**Why daily instead of weekly:**
- Smaller batches (5-15 files/day vs 50-100 files/week)
- Faster feedback loop (catch issues same day as compilation)
- Easier review (2-3 issues/day vs 20-30 issues/week)
- Better context retention (Julius remembers what was compiled)

## Quick start

1. **Scan wiki files** — read all `wiki/sources/*.md` + `wiki/concepts/*.md`
2. **Validate each file** — run 4 quality checks (factual, completeness, coherence, Vietnamese)
3. **Score issues** — assign severity (ERROR/WARNING/INFO)
4. **Generate report** — write to `wiki/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD_output-report.md`
5. **Update action file** — add entry to `wiki/reviews/_action-required.md`
6. **Send notification** — Telegram alert to Julius
7. **Log** to `.hermes/MEMORY.md`

## Critical rules

### Read-only validator
- **Only read** wiki files for validation
- **Only write** to `wiki/reviews/` (reports only)
- **Never modify** wiki content files
- **Never delete** any files

### Quality dimensions (4 checks per file)

1. **Factual accuracy** — Content claims are verifiable and correct
2. **Completeness** — All required sections present with sufficient detail
3. **Coherence** — Logical flow, clear arguments, no contradictions
4. **Vietnamese quality** — Grammar, spelling, natural phrasing (for Vietnamese content)

### Severity levels

| Severity | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **ERROR** | Critical quality issue | Missing definition, factually wrong claim |
| **WARNING** | Should improve | Summary too vague, weak coherence |
| **INFO** | Nice to improve | Could add more examples, minor grammar |

### Scoring threshold

- **ERROR**: Block file from being referenced (move to drafts)
- **WARNING**: File usable but needs improvement
- **INFO**: File acceptable, suggestions only

## Report format

```markdown
# Output Validation — YYYY-MM-DD

**Status:** pending

## Issue 1: [Issue type]

**File:** wiki/<path>/<file>.md
**Severity:** ERROR | WARNING | INFO
**Dimension:** Factual | Completeness | Coherence | Vietnamese
**Issue:** <description>

## Validation criteria summary

### Factual accuracy
- Claims have sources cited
- Technical terms used correctly
- No contradictions with cited sources
- Dates/numbers are accurate

### Completeness
- All required sections present
- Summary is 3-5 sentences
- Key points are 5-10 items
- Definition is 2-3 sentences (concepts only)

### Coherence
- Logical flow between sections
- Arguments are clear and supported
- No internal contradictions
- Transitions make sense

### Vietnamese quality
- Grammar correct (subject-verb agreement, tenses)
- Spelling correct (no typos)
- Natural phrasing (not machine-translated feel)
- Technical terms preserved in English where appropriate

## Constraints

### Write zones
- **Allowed:** `wiki/reviews/` only
- **Forbidden:** `wiki/sources/`, `wiki/concepts/`, `wiki/drafts/`, `wiki/tag/`, `wiki/topic/`, `wiki/meta/`

### Forbidden actions
- ❌ Modifying any wiki content files
- ❌ Deleting files
- ❌ Moving files
- ❌ Creating files outside `wiki/reviews/`
- ❌ Auto-fixing issues (Fix Agent does this after approval)

### Performance
- Validate all files in one pass (don't re-read)
- Cache file content in memory during scan
- **Limit report to top 20 issues per day** (daily runs = smaller batches)
- Skip files in `wiki/drafts/` (already flagged)
- Skip files unchanged since last validation (check `last_updated` field)

## Escalation

Flag for Julius when:

### Ambiguous quality issue
```
[VALIDATION UNCERTAINTY]
File: wiki/concepts/<slug>.md
Issue: Definition seems circular but might be intentional
Question: Is this acceptable or should it be flagged?
```

### Systematic issue detected
```
[SYSTEMATIC ISSUE]
Pattern: 15 files have summaries <2 sentences
Likely cause: Compile Agent prompt needs tuning
Recommendation: Review compile-agent/SKILL.md
```

### Language detection unclear
```
[LANGUAGE UNCLEAR]
File: wiki/sources/src_<slug>.md
Issue: Content mixes English and Vietnamese
Question: Which language should be primary?
```

- [validation-criteria.md](validation-criteria.md) — detailed quality rubrics
- [examples.md](examples.md) — sample reports and issues

## Post-validation

After successful validation run:

1. **Verify report written:**
   ```bash
   test -f "wiki/reviews/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_output-report.md"
   ```

2. **Update _action-required.md:**
   - Add entry to "Pending Reports" section
   - Update "Last updated" timestamp

3. **Send Telegram notification:**
   ```
   📋 Output validation complete
   - Issues found: N (X ERROR, Y WARNING, Z INFO)
   - Files checked: M (K new since last run)
   - Report: wiki/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD_output-report.md
   
   Review: wiki/reviews/_action-required.md
   Commands: 'approve output' or 'show output'
   ```

4. **Log to MEMORY.md:**
   ```markdown
   ## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS — Output validation
   - Files checked: M (X sources + Y concepts)
   - New files: K (compiled today)
   - Issues found: N (A ERROR, B WARNING, C INFO)
   - Report: wiki/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD_output-report.md
   ```

## Batch behavior

Output Validator processes files in one run but optimizes for daily schedule:
- **Scan all files** to maintain full context
- **Prioritize new files** (compiled today) for detailed validation
- **Quick check existing files** for systematic issues only
- Generate single report with issues sorted by severity

**Typical daily run time:** 15-45 seconds for 5-15 new files + quick scan of existing

## Failure modes

| Issue | Action |
|---|---|
| File has no frontmatter | Skip file, log warning |
| File has invalid YAML | Skip file (Format Validator will catch) |
| Cannot determine language | Default to English validation rules |
| LLM call fails (for coherence check) | Skip coherence check, flag in report |
| Disk full | Stop, alert Julius |
| Permission denied on wiki/reviews/ | Stop, alert Julius |
| No new files today | Generate empty report, log "No new files to validate" |

## Performance benchmarks

Typical validation times (daily runs):

| New files | Existing files | Time |
|---|---|---|
| 0-5 | 50-100 | 10-20s |
| 5-15 | 100-200 | 20-45s |
| 15-30 | 200-300 | 45-90s |

**Bottlenecks:**
- Coherence checks (require LLM calls)
- Vietnamese grammar validation (language model)
- Reading many files (I/O)

**Optimization:**
- Batch LLM calls (5-10 files per call)
- Cache common validation patterns
- **Skip unchanged files** (check `last_updated` < today)
- Prioritize ERROR severity checks over INFO checks
